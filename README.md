AlgorithmWStepByStep
====================

Type inference for ML-like languages. A port to F# of "Algorithm W Step by Step" by Martin Grabm√ºller.

I've kept the variable names from the article, to make it easier to follow this code while reading the article.

The only major difference is that the F# port uses local state rather than a monad.

Please see http://www.grabmueller.de/martin/www/pub/AlgorithmW.pdf for documentation.
